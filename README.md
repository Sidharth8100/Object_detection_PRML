This project explores object recognition on the CIFAR-10 dataset using various machine learning and deep learning methods. After preprocessing and dimensionality reduction with PCA, models such as KNN, SVM, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, GMM, DBSCAN, Logistic Regression, ANN, and CNN were implemented and evaluated.
Traditional models achieved moderate accuracy (~30â€“40%), while the CNN significantly outperformed others with ~80.5% accuracy. The results highlight the effectiveness of deep learning for image classification and the importance of feature extraction in high-dimensional data.
